# Rust/WebAsm/HTML5/CSS 

## Testing the limits of JS-minimal web apps

The goal of this project is to create a set of microframeworks for building non-intensive web apps in Rust and Web Asembly that take advantage of their unique features while providing a fast setup and less-difficult coding experience. On the frontend, HTML5 and CSS3 will be utilized to their greatest extents.

### Principles
- Fast and safe
- User-friendly for webdevs not experienced with Rust and/or WebAsm
- Built with simpler web apps in mind
- Taking into account accessibility and promoting clean and effective UI/UX

> [!NOTE]
> While this project aims to minimize use of JS, JS should be used in any case that core functionality or accessibility is not available in HTML/CSS/WebAsm
